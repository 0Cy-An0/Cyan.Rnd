# Cy/an Random

Github of my Ror2 Mod

maybe Ideas:
- void field stuff
    - blacklist items?
    - add monsters from spawn (card?) pool
    - option to get all three items via round robin?

bugs/untested:
- artifact of evolution (if i remember correctly they just don't get items which would make half the options useless)
