# Cy/an Random

Github of my Ror2 Mod

maybe Ideas:
- void field stuff
    - blacklist items?
    - add monsters from spawn (card?) pool
    - option to get all three items via round robin?

bugs/untested:
- artifact of evolution
- what happens with other orbs (like the void field rewards, there is currently no check were you are so if you get them somehwere else it should also give multiplied rewards)
