# Cy/an Random

Does Random stuff I wanted to have in the game:
 - Void Field portal is usable more than once

 Currently just ideas:
 - Monster inherit Items from previous Void Field stages
 - extra Void Field stages increase item drops and monster items by using mountain shrines
    - entering the stage will 'activate' 5 * (number of entries) shrines
    - items can still only be selected once per player but will drop multiplied after selection
    - might add a option to get all three via round robin
