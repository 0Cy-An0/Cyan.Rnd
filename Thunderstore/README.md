# Cy/an Random

Does Random stuff I wanted to have in the game:
 - Remove all Highlights from new unlocks (this is a option in the Settings)
 - Option to enable Crit stacking past 100% and how (if next crit should only roll for a mult increase of +1 or *2)
 - Option to enable Bleed stacking past 100%

 - Void Field portal is usable more than once (fields configurable via Config)
    - Monster inherit Items from previous Void Field stages
    - extra Void Field stages increase item drops and monster items
        - Difficulty Setting to influence item scaling
    - there is a option to get more monsters instead of just 1 type added
    - option to get multiple or also duplicate Itemstacks added
    - various speed and cell percentage Settings
    - check the options or Config for a more detailed list that may include options not listed here

 - config changable with RiskOfOptions
 - saves with ProperSave
